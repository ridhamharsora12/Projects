# Projects

## 1) Counter
-->Implemented a configurable counter circuit with inputs for increment, decrement, and reset, enabling logic-driven count control.

## 2) Digital Clock 
-->I've developed a digital clock that effectively presents hours and minutes. This design is optimized for FPGA utilization, showcasing the time on four seven-segment displays. Additionally, the clock includes a reset button for easy resetting functionality.

## 3) 64 byte RAM 
-->I designed and implemented a 64-byte RAM using Xilinx tools. The project utilized fundamental digital circuit design components, featuring 1-byte data width across 64 locations. The main goal was to establish a solid memory foundation

## 4) Simple Processor
--> I've designed a simple processor comprising four main components: program memory, data memory, a register file, and an ALU. This processor operates by fetching instructions from the program memory. When an instruction requests data, the processor retrieves the variable data from the specified memory address and stores it in the register file. The ALU then performs arithmetic operations using the data stored in the register file based on the provided instructions. Finally, the results of these operations are stored back in the data memory. This seamless interaction between the components enables the processor to effectively execute instructions and carry out arithmetic tasks.
